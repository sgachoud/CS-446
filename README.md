# Project proposals


### Collisions in same mesh and with the floor  
* Detect collisions  
* Determine what to do with the point  
* How to implement (constraints, more)?


### Plastic deformations  
* Compute per edges tensions (length difference)
* Compute per vertices bending (curvature difference)
* Change baseline if too much differenc
* e


Extended goals: 
Point explosion to create force for movement (help for simulation,to create nice effects and yeah...explosions)
